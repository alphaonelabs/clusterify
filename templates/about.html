<div class="content_subtitle">Quick history of the site</div>

<p>Authors: <a href="/accounts/profile/view/fsavard/">François Savard</a>, <a href="/accounts/profile/view/aneeshk/">Aneesh Kulkarni</a>. More to come when "history" is a relevant term :P</p>

<div class="content_subtitle">Site credits</div>

<p>Thanks to all who are helping us with the beta! Feedback is so precciousss.</p>

<p>As some of you will surely note, the design was inspired by <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>. The site is based on <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">the Django framework</a> and uses a little sparkle of <a href="http://www.jquery.com">jQuery</a> for autocomplete. It's hosted over at <a href="http://www.webfaction.com">Webfaction</a>.</p>
