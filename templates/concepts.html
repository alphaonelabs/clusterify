<p>Clusterify is a better way to <strong>meet other programmers working with the same technologies you are</strong>. Open source projects are great, but they usually require large investments of time. The idea here is to <strong>keep it short</strong>, just a couple hours per project. If you have a cool idea for a short project, and want to work on it with a couple other programmers, sign up here to get started!</p>

<p>The site is also about <strong>learning and experimenting, sharing tips</strong> along the way with others.</p>

<p>It's up to you to decide what collaboration tools you're going to use, what language, what framework, what repository... </p>

<div class="content_subtitle">The stages of projects</div>

<ol>
<li>First, you (the project <strong>author</strong>) propose an <strong>idea</strong> (or proposal), and <strong>tag</strong> it with relevant categories.</li>
<li>Afterwards, people can see it on the proposals page, which can be filtered by tags or votes, and accessed through <strong>RSS feeds</strong>.</li>
<li>When a project looks exciting, you just click <strong>join</strong>. If you've got questions or suggestion, you can post <strong>comments</strong> on the project page.</li>
<li>Through this discussion, you all <strong>agree on a date and time</strong> to work on it, and decide what tools you'll use. When you're done, the author sets the <strong>project as completed</strong>. You can show off your work to everyone by posting links to your completed project and blog posts in the <strong>project showcase</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<div class="content_subtitle">Voting</div>

<p>You can vote up ideas you think are exciting. Separately, you can reward a good completed project by voting for it.</p>

<div class="content_subtitle">Profiles</div>

<p>We encourage you to post a profile with links to your online profiles and contact information: <strong>IM number, email, blog/website, Twitter,</strong> etc. It can also be a way to keep in touch with each other after the project.</p>

<div class="content_subtitle">Project showcase</div>
<p>We know a lot of you have blogs, or know how to set one up in a matter of seconds. You can <strong>document the project on your own site</strong>, and provide <strong>links to these in the Project Showcase section</strong> to show off your work.</p>

<p>So go forth and speaketh of your projects in the wide world! This makes for a great "experience log" to share tips you learned in the process.</p>

<p>You can also link back to the project page to have visitors upvote your implementation.</p>

<div class="content_subtitle">The name "Clusterify"</div>

Take a look at this Wikipedia entry on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_clustering">Data clustering</a>. We hope the projects build "clusters" of coders who work well with each other.
