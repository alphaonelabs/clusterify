<p>As said on the Concepts page, we encourage you to propose short projects: <strong>2 hours or so</strong>. Now, 2 hours is an awfully short amount of time for software development. Is it really enough for a project done by 2-4 persons? Won't you be spending more time fussing with task division and other <strong>collaboration overhead?</strong></p>

<p>The site is young, and that's something we'll have to see. But we do propose a few <strong>tips</strong>:

<ul>
<li>Really do keep the scope small!</li>
<li>Propose ideas which <strong>lend themselves naturally to task division</strong>, with features rather independent of one another.
	<ul>
	<li>Authors: try to think ahead of how you're going to divide the task, and document it in the project description.</li>
	<li>In the end, the more people you'll have on the team, the more features in your breakdown you'll be able to implement.</li>

	</ul>
</li>
<li>Try to have a precise idea of what you're going to do before you start it, reaching that point through discussion on the project page. Use the <strong>project page comments to brainstorm</strong>.</li>
<li>DON'T PANIC! :P This is about having fun while developing with new people.</li>
</ul>

<div class="content_subtitle">What to put in a project description</div>

Here are the basics of a good description:

<ul>
	<li>Idea refinement, details: make it clear</li>

	<li>Task breakdown: what are the subtasks? How can the project be divided?</li>
	<li>The <strong>tools</strong> and <strong>technologies</strong> you're going to use. Try to set up accounts before the project starts, and send invites to members.</li>
	<li>When you settle on it: the <strong>date/time</strong> to work on the project</li>

</ul>

<div class="content_subtitle">Tool suggestions</div>

We don't enforce the use of this or that tool. On the contrary, we think diversity and trying new stuff is the point of this site. Yet a list might be useful.

<ul>
	<li>Scheduling meetings: <a href="http://www.doodle.com">Doodle</a></li>
	<li>Code repository hosting (most also offer other collaboration features)
	<ul>
		<li>Free for public/open source code
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://code.google.com">Google Code</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://www.assembla.com">Assembla</a></li>

			<li><a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://www.sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a></li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Free and allows private source
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.xp-dev.com">XP-Dev</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://beanstalkapp.com/">Beanstalk</a> (free for 3 users, 15 MB)</li>

		</ul></li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Chat while working on the project
	<ul>
		<li>Good ol' IRC</li>
		<li>Sites with chat log and images: <a href="http://www.campfirenow.com">Campfire</a>, <a href="http://www.echowaves.com">echowaves</a></li>
		<li>Also take a look at EtherPad, mentioned bellow</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.meebo.com">Meebo</a> rooms, and most IMs have group chat features</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Sharing code snippets (for chat sessions): <a href="http://pastie.org/">Pastie</a></li>
	<li>Documenting (sharing code, links, tips, etc. with the team):
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.wikidot.com">Wikidot</a>: has source code syntax coloring features</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.etherpad.com">EtherPad</a>: one text page, could not be simpler to setup, allows you to work in real time and see changes made by others instantly (suggested by psytek)</li>
		<li>Also note that Google Code and systems like Trac integrate a Wiki</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Blogs (for project showcase): <a href="http://www.wordpress.com">Wordpress</a>, <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a>, <a href="http://www.livejournal.com">LiveJournal</a>, and <a href="http://mashable.com/2007/08/06/free-blog-hosts/">so many others</a></li>
	<li>Coding: ah, well, now that's up to you :P</li>
</ul>
